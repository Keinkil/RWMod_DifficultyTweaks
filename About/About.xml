A custom Difficulty. Designed for personal use.
Instead of modifying sliders every time we start a new game, we simply load this!
We still have to modify a few sliders:
* Friendly Fire chance
* Colonist Instant Kill
* Wealth Time Factor

These don't appear to have an exposed DifficultyDef to modify.

Feel free to use and abuse to create your own preset.
